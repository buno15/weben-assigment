    <h1>Holidays in August</h1>
    <h2>Day 1 (08/08)</h2>
    <p>Today, I play badminton with my father. My father is a badminton player.<br> When he was a child, he plaied
        badminton
        in a long time. I'm also training, so I practiced together today.</p>
    <h2>Day 2 (08/09)</h2>
    <p>I went running with my father today. He will play an important match a week later. He was taken to practice for
        that.<br> I also run and train normally, so it was fast. So I became his pacemaker and ran with him.</p>
